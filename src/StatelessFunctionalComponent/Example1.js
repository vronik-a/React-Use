// When you separate a container component from a presentational component, the presentational component will always end up like this: one render() function, and no other properties.

// If you have a component class with nothing but a render function, then you can rewrite that component class in a very different way. Instead of using React.Component, you can write it as a JavaScript function!

import React from "react";

// A component class written as a function is called a stateless functional component. Stateless functional components have some advantages over typical component classes. Weâ€™ll cover those advantages in this lesson.
// export class Friend extends React.Component {
//   render() {
//     return (
//       <img
//         src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-octopus.jpg"
//         alt="anImage"
//       />
//     );
//   }
// }

// class rewritten as a fuction. The same component class, written as a stateless functional component:
export const Friend = () => {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-octopus.jpg"
      alt="anImage"
    />
  );
};
